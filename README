== Busy App ==

A list manager that I am building to help me keep track of things that need to be done.  I loosely follow the GTD principles.  Currently the application is trying to be simple, I might forgo the idea of context/areas in favor of individual lists (if you need a next list for home and work, then thats 2 lists).

Keeping the features simple, I hope to be able to:

* Get the interface on the iPhone via HTML5 + Safari
* Daily/Weekly style email lists delivered to your inbox in HTML glory
* A quick and functional web application interface.
