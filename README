== Busy App ==

A list manager that I am building to help me keep track of things that need to be done.  I loosely follow the GTD principles.  Currently the application is trying to be simple, I might forgo the idea of context/areas in favor of individual lists (if you need a next list for home and work, then thats 2 lists).

Keeping the features simple, I hope to be able to:

* Get the interface on the iPhone via HTML5 + Safari
* Daily/Weekly style email lists delivered to your inbox in HTML glory
* A quick and functional web application interface.

And in the future, maybe we'll get to

* Project support
* Checklists (i.e. sets of tasks that are scheduled on a repeating basis)
